            "    Intraplate or Deep Quakes occur at depths of 30-70 km in oceanic crust as it dives under lighter continental crust. Because of the depth, even buildings located right above them are far enough away that seismic waves are attenuated. An example of a deep earthquake is the M6.8 Nisqually Earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Northwest in 2001.\n" +
            "    Subduction Zone or Megathrust Quakes occur on the interface between the North American plate and the Juan de Fuca plate, a small plate extending from northern California to British Columbia.
